# Chargify
Chargify is an android app that enables the user to get the accurate location of nearby charging points.
# Key features:
● The app gives the location of nearby charging points, including the real time
distance and the time required by the user to reach a specific charging
location.
● The app gives user the review and the description of a particular place,
thereby allowing the user to choose the charging point of his choice.
● The app gives user the type of location, whether public or private, where user
also has the feature to to mark the location as accessible.
● The app gives user the status of charging point, whether in use or not.
● The app gives user the approximate time required for the charging point to be
free, if in use.
● The app is properly integrated with Maps where user gets the proper markers
for different kinds of locations, so that the user finds no difficulty in reaching a
particular location
# Tech Stack:
● Java for Android Development
● Django + Django REST Framework
● Adobe Illustrator
# Utility:
● The app helps the user in critical condition when the user's battery is
about to drain in an unfamiliar location.
● The app comes handy when the user requires high battery levels in transit.
# Future Implementation
● The app will help user to get the approximate time required for charging
without even connecting the charger using the current battery status and
charging point specifications so that the user can know about the time
required for better planning.
● The app will help the user to get the location of charging points close to a
different location so that the user can get the closest charging point when he
reaches a particular location.
● The app will use Machine Learning algorithms to judge the availability of
charging points near a particular location at a future instance.
# Bugs
● The frontend is unpleasant.
● The feature for marking the private locations friendly is not working properly.
● The location is not updated instantaneously so the GPS must be ON for
minimum 1-2 minutes.
